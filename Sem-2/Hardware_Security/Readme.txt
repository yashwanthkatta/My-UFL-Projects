TEST CODES is a folder that has all the extra techniques we used and couldn't implement them. It is just to prove that we
tried till the last minute to not give challenge bits manually.

NOTE:

1. The .zip file contains the report, folders containing codes for each PUF and MATLAB scripts for performance analysis.

2. We have included all the codes as requested. We have included the responses as well, just in case you would like to 
cross-check.

3. To execute any PUF, upload the code onto Xilinx ISE Design Suite 14.7, for Spartan 6 LX45 design with CSG324 packaging,
and then generate the bit stream and run it on the board.

4. Once the response files have been obtained, run the matlab scripts from the directory that have the corresponding 
excel files.

	The results are legit and are aligning with our theoretical expectations.
